### RTMA_CONUS Class

This class hosts the active functions that download the 2.5km x 2.5km Real Time Mesoscale Analysis (RTMA) Data. 

This class hosts the functions the users will import and call if the users wish to download the data outside of the 
plotting function and pass the data into the plotting function.

This is the recommended method for users who wish to create a large amount of graphics at one time to limit the number of server requests.

#### download_NDFD_grids(directory_name, parameter)

This function retrieves the latest NWS Forecast (NDFD) files from the NWS FTP Server. 

Scripts that download files from the CONUS directory are recommended to be run between the 48th and 15th 
minute to avoid the script idiling. The reason is because the files in the CONUS directory update between the 15th
and 48th minute of the hour (and downloading them during that time makes them extremely hard to work with!!). Due
to this, if there is an issue with the data, the program will automatically idle until the 48th minute and resume and try again to download the latest data. 

Data Source: NOAA/NWS/NDFD (tgftp.nws.noaa.gov)

Required Arguments: 

1) The name of the directory (see FireWxPy documentation for [directory paths](#directory-paths))

2) The parameter that the user wishes to download. (i.e. ds.maxt.bin for max temperature)

Returns: 

1) The files holding the forecast data in a GRIB2 format. 

2) An xarray data-array of the same forecast data. 

3) The count of the number of files in the short-term forecast period. 

4) The count of the number of files in the extended forecast period.

Optional Arguments: 

1) get_u_and_v_wind_components (Boolean) - Default = False. When having the typeOfLevel set to 'heightAboveGround' there is an issue
                                           with retrieving the u and v wind components. You will see an error message. Fortunately, 
                                           in FireWxPy we fix that for you so you can disregard the errors. When setting this value to True
                                           you will also return lists of the u and v datasets. 

2) add_wind_gusts (Boolean) - Default = True. When having get_u_and_v_wind_components=True, you can opt to add an additional list to be 
                              returned which will have the wind gust dataset. 

Returns: Depending on the values you enter above determines how many lists of datasets are returned. 

If the user does not use 'GEFS0p25 ENS MEAN' for the model of choice, a single list of the datasets are returned. 

If the user uses 'GEFS0p25 ENS MEAN' and does not have typeOfLevel set to 'heightAboveGround', a single list of the datasets are returned. 

If the user uses 'GEFS0p25 ENS MEAN' and does have typeOfLevel set to 'heightAboveGround' while get_u_and_v_wind_components=False, a single list of the datasets are returned. 

If the user uses 'GEFS0p25 ENS MEAN' and does have typeOfLevel set to 'heightAboveGround' while get_u_and_v_wind_components=True and get_u_and_v_wind_components=False,
a list of the 'heightAboveGround' datasets, u-wind datasets and v-wind datasets will be returned. 

If the user uses 'GEFS0p25 ENS MEAN' and does have typeOfLevel set to 'heightAboveGround' while get_u_and_v_wind_components=True and get_u_and_v_wind_components=True,
a list of the 'heightAboveGround' datasets, u-wind datasets, v-wind datasets and gust datasets will be returned.


## ***Standard Module***

***Functions***

1) [plot_creation_time()](#plot_creation_time)

#### plot_creation_time()

This function uses the datetime module to find the time at which the script ran. 

This can be used in many ways:

1) Timestamp for graphic in both local time and UTC
2) When downloading data with functions in the data_access module, this function is called to find 
the time which is passed into the data downloading functions in order for the latest data to be
downloaded. 

There are no variables to pass into this function. 

Returns: 

1) Current Local Time
2) Current UTC Time

## ***Dims Module***

***Functions***

1) [get_metar_mask(state, gacc_region, rtma_ws=False)](#get_metar_maskstate-gacc_region-rtma_wsfalse)

#### get_metar_mask(state, gacc_region, rtma_ws=False)

This function returns the METAR mask for a given state or GACC region. 

Required Arguments:

1) state (String) - The two letter state abbreviation for the state the user wishes to make the graphic for. 
                            If the user wishes to make a graphic for the entire CONUS, there are 4 acceptable abbreviations: 'US' or 'us'
                            or 'USA' or 'usa'. Example: If the user wishes to make a plot for the state of California both 'CA' or 'ca' are
                            acceptable. Default setting is 'us'. If the user wishes to make a plot based on gacc_region, this value must be 
                            changed to None. 


2) gacc_region (String) - The abbreviation for each of the 10 GACC regions. Default setting is None. 
                            If the user wishes to make a plot based on GACC Region than state, the state variable must be set to 
                            None and the gacc_region variable must be set to one of the acceptable abbreviations. 

Here is a list of acceptable gacc_region abbreviations:

South Ops: 'OSCC' or 'oscc' or 'SOPS' or 'sops'

North Ops: 'ONCC' or 'oncc' or 'NOPS' or 'nops'

Great Basin: 'GBCC' or 'gbcc' or 'GB' or 'gb'

Northern Rockies: 'NRCC' or 'nrcc' or 'NR' or 'nr'

Rocky Mountain: 'RMCC' or 'rmcc' or 'RM' or 'rm'

Southwest: 'SWCC' or 'swcc' or 'SW' or 'sw'

Southern: 'SACC' or 'sacc' or 'SE' or 'se'

Eastern: 'EACC' or 'eacc' or 'E' or 'e'

Pacific Northwest: 'PNW' or 'pnw' or 'NWCC' or 'nwcc' or 'NW' or 'nw'

Alaska: Setting state='AK' or state='ak' suffices here. Leave gacc_region=None and set the state variable as shown.

  Optional Arguments:
  
  1) rtma_ws (Boolean) - Default = False. When set to False, the mask value returned is for when the user wants to create full station plots.
     When rtma_ws=True, the mask returned is for when the user is only plotting wind barbs of observed winds from the METAR observations rather than the full station plot.

Returns: The value of the mask applied to the METAR observations. This way station plots aren't cluttered over each other.
